# dox.capital

## Overview

`dox.capital` is a project that provides a tool for discovering wallets by cross-checking holder data.

## How it Works

1. **Upload Etherscan holder data**: Users can inpload multiple csv files that can be downloaded from the holder data section on a Etherscan token page.

2. **Cross-Check Process**: The tool performs a cross-check analysis based on the holder data, checking how many times each wallet appears in each CSV.

3. **Visualization**: The results are presented in a table, ordered by how often a wallet appears in all CSV files.
